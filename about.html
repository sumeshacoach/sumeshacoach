    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Eesha, a certified lifestyle and fitness coach with a global background and a heart full of passion for helping others. My approach is rooted in connection, empathy, and holistic care — I believe that true wellness is not just about workouts and nutrition but about feeling truly seen, supported, and empowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it’s your first step on this journey or you’re already halfway there, I’m here to guide you with professional insight and heartfelt support. I’m deeply passionate about nurturing my clients toward discovering their best selves — physically, mentally, and emotionally. And the one thing I hear most often? That people feel instantly at ease with me. Comfortable, nurtured, and truly at home — even if we’ve only just met. That’s what makes my work not just effective, but deeply meaningful.
    </p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      My journey began in 2019 when I received my international Zumba license — a decision that would open doors to a life I truly love. From there, I became a certified personal trainer and soon found myself traveling the world as a fitness trainer on luxury cruise ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with people from different cultures and backgrounds taught me not only technical expertise but also how to connect deeply with individuals and understand their unique needs. It was an incredible chapter — full of movement, learning, and growth — but my heart always longed for something deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I realized my real passion lies in making a true impact on people’s lives — guiding them toward sustainable wellness, helping them find motivation, and most importantly, making them feel seen and supported. That’s why I now work independently, focusing on building meaningful, goal-oriented programs that touch every aspect of well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      And everywhere I go, whether on sea or land, I carry one truth with me: that when someone feels comfortable, heard, and cared for, transformation begins naturally. This is my purpose, and I am deeply honored to share it with you.
    </p>
