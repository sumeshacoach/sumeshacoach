    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome! I'm so glad you're here. I'm Eesha, the heart behind Sumesha Wellness.
      My mission is simple but powerful — to help you unlock your full potential and feel truly at home in your own body and mind.
    </p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      My fitness journey began in 2019 when I earned my international Zumba license, igniting a passion for movement and wellness that has only grown since.
      I later became a certified personal trainer, deepening my understanding of physical fitness and the human body.
      Over time, I gained hands-on experience by working as a fitness trainer on luxury cruise ships — traveling the world while helping people from different walks of life find joy and strength through wellness.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I loved the excitement of life at sea, I realized that my true purpose was bigger than just fitness. It was about people.
      I found deep satisfaction in guiding individuals toward their personal goals, helping them feel empowered, and creating a space where they felt seen, supported, and celebrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I noticed, time and time again, is how people felt comfortable, nurtured, and at home with me — even if it was our very first meeting.
      That special connection, the ability to make someone feel truly safe and cared for, is what sets me apart. It’s not just about workouts — it’s about walking with you through transformation.
    </p>

    <h2>Client Testimonials from the Cruise</h2>
    <p>Here are some real words from clients I had the honor of working with while on cruise ships:</p>
