      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Eesha Salvi</strong>, the founder of Sumesha Wellness. I’m a certified lifestyle coach with a strong vision to help people transform not just their bodies, but their overall lives. My passion lies in supporting individuals from all walks of life to take control of their well-being—physically, mentally, and emotionally. I believe that real wellness goes far beyond appearance. It’s about how you feel, how you live, and how you connect with yourself and the world around you.</p>

      <p>Over the years, I’ve worked with more than <strong>1,500 international clients</strong>, helping them achieve sustainable changes through personalized strategies. At Sumesha, we prioritize people over programs. I take time to understand each person’s unique goals, habits, struggles, and lifestyle. My approach is always gentle, compassionate, and goal-oriented—so every individual feels supported from day one.</p>

      <h2>Why Choose Me?</h2>
      <p>What truly makes my coaching different is the connection I create with each person. I don’t just offer solutions—I offer presence. My clients are never just numbers; they are people I deeply care about. Whether someone is starting from scratch or looking for that extra push, I’m here to help them feel empowered, encouraged, and inspired.</p>

      <p>With experience across diverse backgrounds and cultures, I understand that no two journeys are the same. That’s why I offer a balanced combination of professional fitness coaching, therapeutic support, and nutritional guidance. I believe transformation should be accessible, enjoyable, and something you look forward to every day. My clients often tell me that I bring a calm yet powerful energy to their lives—and that motivates me to do even more.</p>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>My journey into fitness and wellness began in <strong>2019</strong> when I received my international license as a Zumba instructor. That step opened doors for me to understand the joy and power of movement. I quickly pursued my certification as a personal trainer and began my professional experience as a fitness coach on luxury cruise ships. There, I had the opportunity to work with individuals from all over the world, giving me a global perspective on wellness and human connection.</p>

      <p>While traveling the world and helping others, I discovered something deeply meaningful—people felt safe around me. Many clients, even those meeting me for the very first time, would say they felt nurtured, understood, and at home in my presence. This wasn’t just about exercise or nutrition anymore—it was about connection, comfort, and creating a space where people could truly be themselves. That emotional trust became my greatest strength as a coach.</p>

      <p>Eventually, I realized my true passion wasn’t just in fitness—it was in helping people transform their lifestyles in ways that felt sustainable and fulfilling. I left the cruise life behind and committed to building Sumesha Wellness as a space for transformation. Today, my goal is to offer meaningful, affordable, and heart-driven coaching for everyone ready to embrace a healthier, happier life.</p>
