      <h2>1-on-1 Personal Training</h2>
      <p>Experience the power of transformation with personalized, one-on-one coaching that fits your body, schedule, and goals. Whether you're starting from scratch or upgrading your fitness level, I design every session to empower you with confidence, clarity, and strength.</p>
      <p>With expertise in <strong>Pilates, Yoga, Strength Training, and HIIT</strong>, I guide you through movement that enhances flexibility, tones your body, builds endurance, and relieves stress. You’re never doing the same boring routine — every session is crafted with care, energy, and a deep understanding of your journey.</p>
      <p>My coaching goes beyond exercise — it’s motivation, mindset, and mentorship. Clients say I bring something different: a rare combination of empathy, insight, and discipline. Together, we’ll build habits that last and create results that feel amazing. I don’t just train — I inspire transformation.</p>

      <h2>Online Therapy Sessions</h2>
      <p>Your emotional well-being deserves just as much care as your physical health. My online therapy sessions are designed to help you navigate life’s challenges with calm, clarity, and strength. Whether you're going through stress, anxiety, confusion, or emotional burnout, I’m here to listen, guide, and support you — with no judgment.</p>
      <p>Through structured conversations and reflective guidance, we’ll uncover blocks, reframe your thinking, and reconnect you with your inner strength. I use compassionate methods that blend psychology and coaching so that you don’t just feel better — you feel equipped to move forward with peace.</p>
      <p>Clients often say that even in our first session, they feel at home with me. That safety, connection, and care is what makes my therapy space so unique. I’m not just a therapist — I’m your safe place, cheerleader, and trusted guide.</p>

      <h2>Customized Nutrition Planning</h2>
      <p>Fuel your lifestyle with a nutrition plan that’s customized just for you. No generic meal plans, no extreme diets — only thoughtful guidance that helps you eat well, feel energized, and stay consistent without giving up the food you love.</p>
      <p>We’ll work together to understand your goals, your habits, your schedule, and even your cravings — then create a plan that is realistic, nourishing, and enjoyable. Whether your focus is weight loss, muscle tone, digestion, or balanced living, I’ll help you get there with smart, sustainable strategies.</p>
      <p>My approach makes nutrition feel like self-care, not sacrifice. You’ll learn how to eat with awareness, love your meals, and see food as a tool for joy and well-being. With me, you’re never alone — I walk beside you every bite of the way.</p>
