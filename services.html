      <h2>1-on-1 Personal Training</h2>
      <p>Transform your body and mind with customized, one-on-one personal training sessions designed just for you. Whether you're a beginner or someone with years of experience, I adapt each session to meet your goals, pace, and physical needs. From building strength and endurance to improving flexibility and posture, we’ll build a plan that works with your lifestyle and supports your long-term wellness.</p>
      <p>My expertise includes a variety of formats such as <strong>Pilates, yoga, strength training, and HIIT</strong>. This means we can tailor your sessions based on what your body truly needs—whether it's high-energy performance training or calm, restorative movement. With my guidance, every workout becomes a step toward becoming the healthiest, most confident version of yourself.</p>
      <p>What makes me different? Clients often say they’ve never felt more understood, supported, and motivated. I don't just train bodies—I empower people. This isn’t a generic program. It’s a personal transformation journey with someone who truly cares about your progress. That’s the Sumesha difference.</p>

      <h2>Online Therapy Sessions</h2>
      <p>Emotional and mental wellness are just as important as physical health. My online therapy sessions offer a safe, confidential space where you can express, reflect, and grow. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or simply need someone to talk to, I’m here to support you with tools, perspective, and compassion.</p>
      <p>These sessions are tailored to your emotional needs, and designed to help you build inner resilience, better manage stress, and find clarity. With warmth and honesty, we’ll work through limiting beliefs, negative patterns, and help you rediscover the strength within. This is about real healing—and real progress.</p>
      <p>Clients describe my approach as calming, insightful, and deeply grounding. Even if you’ve never tried therapy before, I’ll guide you gently through the process so you feel empowered and safe. You don’t have to carry your emotional weight alone. Let’s heal and grow—together.</p>

      <h2>Customized Nutrition Planning</h2>
      <p>Your body deserves to be nourished with intention. I create customized nutrition plans that go beyond calorie counts and strict rules. Instead, I focus on balanced, realistic eating habits that align with your lifestyle, health goals, and cultural preferences. Food is not just fuel—it’s joy, comfort, and power. My job is to help you enjoy it with awareness and confidence.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re aiming for fat loss, muscle gain, improved digestion, or just healthier habits, I’ll help you build a positive relationship with food. We’ll design a plan that energizes your body without making you feel deprived. I’ll be there with constant support, guidance, and motivation every step of the way.</p>
      <p>This isn’t about dieting. It’s about freedom—freedom to eat, move, and live without guilt or confusion. That’s the kind of nutrition plan I believe in. And with me, you’re not alone—you have a coach who listens, adapts, and celebrates your wins with you.</p>
